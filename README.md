![Project Preview](preview.png)

## Overview

**Halo** is a virtual mental wellbeing assistant designed to help users reflect on their emotions and daily experiences. Built around Hume's [Empathic Voice Interface](https://hume.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/empathic-voice-interface-evi/overview) using the Hume React SDK, Halo uses emotionally intelligent AI to analyze conversations and provide meaningful insights.

This project is built on **Next.js App Router** and integrates various advanced technologies, including the **GEMINI API** for conversation history analysis and **Google Echo** to gather and summarize emotional data. By focusing on users' mental health, Halo offers an empathetic companion that checks in, interacts, and assists in maintaining a positive emotional state.
